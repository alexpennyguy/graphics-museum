The icecream texture is created by Freepik (freepik.com). 

I think that's all I have to do.
Not gonna lie, I don't trust Freepik. It's a sketchy website. Maybe don't go to there. *~

Hello again, I'll try not to write a novel this time. This assignment is awesome I'm going to get >100%. So good. I enjoyed working on this one, and I'm sad this class is over. But oh well.

I used Processing on a 2010/2011 Sony Vaio laptop with Ubuntu installed. I don't what the graphics hard ware on this thing is, but it's not very good. It was able to run Oblivion on max at like 30 fps back in the day though.

So, for things that are better than required. Every exhibit has a nice pedestal. That wasn't required, and I think it's quite nice. 
My avatar/visitors are pretty detailed with the amount of geometry they have. 
Someone in class asked if it could just be a rectangle with a rotating sphere head, so I think I did a little better than what was required. 
I like my cat. Also, almost all of the geometry was made myself, except for the spheres and one box (for the lollipop stem). 
All the other cubes are from the drawCube class. Those pyramids are created by me too. 

So yes, instead of just doing one feature, I did two. I don't feel like I have enough time for a third, because I need to study for the HCI final. 
The two I chose are the "Other visitors" and "Over-the-shoulder third person". 
One of the visitors has a pyramid head (not Pyramid Head from Silent Hill), and the other is a little kitty cat. 
They move in some way randomly every time the user does. As far as I can tell, you cannot occupy the same space as they do, nor do they overlap each other at any point. 
To access Over-the-shoulder hit the "q" key. The camera doesn't noticeably clip into anything, and it's pretty smooth.
I think everything works great. So this assignment was awesome.

I hope you have a great winter break! And happy marking!

ALEX OUT.
