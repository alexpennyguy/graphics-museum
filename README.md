# First Person Museum

## Description
**Note: The code in this assignment is a little ugly. It doesn't follow DRY or SOLID or really anything. I made this before having great personal coding standards.**

This assignment was written in Processing for Computer Graphics. It's a first person museum in which the user can examine four simple
exhibits. Each exhibit had to have at least two shapes and some kind of animation. Also, for bonus marks, I added 2 special features.
Pressing "Q" makes the camera third-person, and there are two visitors who randomly wander around the museum. One visitor is an orange cat and the other is a human with a pyramid head. I love this assignment.

I got 120% on it.
